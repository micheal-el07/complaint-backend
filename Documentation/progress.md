1. Task was started with high level project flow planning, this give rough picture of how the system should flow.
2. Route that are involved also plan out, with the example of input body that will be received from user.

7. Tech-stack, Node JS with Typescript is choosen for this project as NodeJS can be considered as unopinionated frameworks.
8. This framework gave the opportunity for developers to plan and design their system accordingly with being tied to specific architecture.
9. Typescript enforced the used of type in declaring variables to ensure for type safety and it is more readable and easier to be maintain compared to Javascript.
